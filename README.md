## üìò Overview  
The **Twitter Financial News Classification** project focuses on building an intelligent text classification pipeline capable of identifying financial tweet topics such as *Earnings, Analyst Updates, Stock Movement,* and *M&A News.*  

This project leverages **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Deep Learning** to interpret financial content and provide insights that can support traders, analysts, and AI-driven finance applications.  

The model was trained and validated on real-world financial tweets to achieve high accuracy and generalization performance.

## ‚ùì Problem Statement  
With millions of finance-related tweets published daily, manual classification is impractical.  
This project aims to automate the categorization of financial tweets ‚Äî enabling analysts and systems to:  
- Monitor breaking financial news efficiently  
- Detect trends across financial topics  
- Facilitate automated sentiment and topic analysis in real time

## üéØ Key Objectives  
‚úÖ Preprocess and clean raw Twitter data (remove links, hashtags, punctuation)  
‚úÖ Perform detailed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify distribution and imbalance  
‚úÖ Extract numerical features using **CountVectorizer** and **Tokenizer**  
‚úÖ Build and compare **CNN**, **RNN**, and **ANN** architectures  
‚úÖ Achieve high validation accuracy with deep learning techniques  
‚úÖ Provide an explainable and scalable text classification pipeline
