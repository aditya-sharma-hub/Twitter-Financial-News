## 📘 Overview  
The **Twitter Financial News Classification** project focuses on building an intelligent text classification pipeline capable of identifying financial tweet topics such as *Earnings, Analyst Updates, Stock Movement,* and *M&A News.*  

This project leverages **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Deep Learning** to interpret financial content and provide insights that can support traders, analysts, and AI-driven finance applications.  

The model was trained and validated on real-world financial tweets to achieve high accuracy and generalization performance.

## ❓ Problem Statement  
With millions of finance-related tweets published daily, manual classification is impractical.  
This project aims to automate the categorization of financial tweets — enabling analysts and systems to:  
- Monitor breaking financial news efficiently  
- Detect trends across financial topics  
- Facilitate automated sentiment and topic analysis in real time

## 🎯 Key Objectives  
✅ Preprocess and clean raw Twitter data (remove links, hashtags, punctuation)  
✅ Perform detailed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify distribution and imbalance  
✅ Extract numerical features using **CountVectorizer** and **Tokenizer**  
✅ Build and compare **CNN**, **RNN**, and **ANN** architectures  
✅ Achieve high validation accuracy with deep learning techniques  
✅ Provide an explainable and scalable text classification pipeline
